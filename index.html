  <h1>To Saavi</h1>

  <p>Some moments in life are so pure, so unexpected, that they quietly shape your heart forever. For me, this Goa trip — <em>with you</em> — was exactly that.</p>

  <p>It started as a solo escape... but when you said yes to joining me, everything changed. That small “yes” turned into one of the most meaningful experiences of my life.</p>

  <p>I still remember waiting at the bus stand, nervous and unsure. But the moment we began exploring, the nervousness faded, and something beautiful unfolded. From brunch at Kiki, to street shopping, to riding through Goa on my bike — it all felt like a dream.</p>

  <p>That evening at Baga Beach, just sitting with you and the sea — I felt light. At peace. And then came South Goa, the food, the laughter, those photos of you smiling — you were happy, and that made me happy.</p>

  <p>And then *Thalasa*. Music, dancing, your glowing words about me — how I was caring, genuine, honest. You don’t know what that meant to me.</p>

  <p>But the deepest moment? That beach talk. Just you and me, no filters, no roles. You trusted me with your story. That’s something I’ll never forget.</p>

  <p>And then... you left. At the bus stop, as you were boarding, you said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Bhavesh, you’re such a genuine and caring person.<br>
    Goa trip will always be remembered for a lifetime.<br>
    I’d want a husband like you someday.<br>
    Whoever ends up with you — she’ll be the luckiest girl alive.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>Those words didn’t just make me smile. They filled me. They gave me a kind of peace I hadn’t known. For the first time, I felt like I’d truly *won* — not love, but the respect of a wonderful soul.</p>

  <p>As your bus pulled away, I stood there… and in my heart, one song played on loop:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>अभी न जाओ छोड़ कर के दिल अभी भरा नहीं<br>
    अभी अभी तो आई हो, बहार बन के छाई हो<br>
    हवा ज़रा महक तो ले, नज़र ज़रा बहक तो ले…</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Because truly, <em>dil abhi bhara nahi tha.</em></p>

  <p>Thank you, Saavi. For those days. For your presence. For making this memory — a lifetime one.</p>
